**The MERN stack is a set of techologies often used to build full stack web apps.**

Here is what each technology in the MERN stack is for :
- **MongoDB**: The NoSQL database will handle data storage and retrieval for our application.

- **Express.js**: As the backend framework, Express.js will help to manage routing, handling HTTP requests, and setting up APIs.

- **React**: The frontend will be built using React, allowing to creating dynamic user interfaces with reusable components.

- **Node.js**: The server-side environment, powered by Node.js, will execute JavaScript code and manage the backend logic.
